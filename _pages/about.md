I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2012 and my supervisor is Prof. Lihua Yue. And I was a visiting scientist (guest researcher) in 2011 at the Spoken Language Systems Laboratory, Saarland University, Germany, hosted by Prof. Dietrich Klakow. In addition, I was a software engineer in Alibaba Group Research & Development in 2010.
